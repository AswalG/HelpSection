Relations
=========

It depicts the detailed relation and the different way how a metadata
model is related to others. The user can select metadata models from the
left side to see their respective relation. The relations are not
necessarily to be hierarchical, it can be in either way. It highlights
if we hover the mouse on nodes (Nodes are circles). The nodes (circles
in orange, green and blue color) are metadata models and the name of
their relation with each other is displayed if we hover the mouse on
connecting lines. In a hierarchical relation, the relation is described
straightforward as front and back whereas in a non-hierarchical it can
be both ways, for example, Parent nodes can be on top of child nodes and
vice versa, it's not fixed. Any change in direction of connection may
reflect the changes for navigation through the connected data objects.
In a hierarchical relation, it is described straightforward as front and
back whereas in a non-hierarchical it can be either way, for example,
Parent nodes can be on top of child nodes and vice versa, it's not
fixed. At the right corner below is the representation of relations
which are displayed by nodes and are shown in three different colors
viz. orange, blue and green:

::

         Orange - Depicts the selected node, so if we select a node it breaks up into - "add relation above" and "add relation below"

         Blue   - Depicts the relation which is above the selected (current) node

         Green - Depicts the relation which is below the selected (current) node 

`**I can add or edit the relations of metadata models by following
