**Dynamic Field**
=================

A dynamic field is a special kind of field, created to extend the
information stored on database. These fields are not fixed in the system
and they can appear only in specific screens, they can be mandatory or
not, and their representation in the screens depends on the field type
defined at their creation time according to the data to be held by the
field.
