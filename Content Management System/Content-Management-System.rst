Content Management System
=========================

• It integrates document management, digital asset management, and
records retention functionalities, and provides end users with
role-based access to the organization's digital assets. It also
facilitates collaborative authoring for websites and includes a web
content management publishing functionality

• This screen will display those metadata models which user has
configured and are listed at the left side of the screen. So, this means
that every user can have their respective set of metadata models.

• Hover the mouse over any metadata model it will display meta modules
like relation, annotation fields, forms, dynamic fields, CM-fields and
E-depots. Every metadata model has its own sub-modules which can be
configured.

• The user won't be able to add new metadata model into the system as
most of them are configured.

• There is also a search space where we can search for particular
metadata model

• A small arrow at right corner will minimize the metadata models list
