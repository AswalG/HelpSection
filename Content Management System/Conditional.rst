statement that, if proved true, performs a function or displays
information. If condition is true, then single statement or multiple
statement executes, otherwise skipped and control is transferred to
statement following the if clause

**• The if/else:** These statements executes a block of code if a
specified condition is true. If the condition is false, another block of
