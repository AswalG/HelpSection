Reproduction
============

This section provides the reproduction category and it means that
originators allow users to reproduce their work. The reproduction types
consist of description, amount, digital, able to downloaded, videos and
its resolutions etc. This screen will come up with the number of
reproductive items which a user may add to cart and download while
making the payment of the displayed cost of items. The user can also
assign flag if they require a high-resolution video. All items for
reproduction can be ordered by users.

**Reproduction Category**

It categorizes the way item can be reproduced, for example, direct
download, the colored photograph of any item, scan copy of any item etc.
So these are the different ways in which an item can be reproduced by
users. Categories are seen on the left side of the web shop reproduction
screen and the user can add/edit/delete the category.
