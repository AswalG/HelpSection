Index Type
==========

This helps to access data faster in-memory. In this section, a user has
to define the type of index for the books or records. Indexes are useful
to access specific and useful data because they are configured by
defining different kinds of files which are kind of index. This section
defines and collaborates different type of indexes with respect to their
books or records. The type of index is used while configuring indexes
which is shown in a dropdown list. So index type acts as a repository of
records, which are associated with their specific type. For example,
index type is created as 'birth records' so now the index of birth
record type will be created in indexed and linked with 'birth record'

We've tried to cover most of the type of indexes but if it all user
wants to add or edit the type he/she can do so.
