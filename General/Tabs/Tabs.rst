Tabs
====

They are used to contain the source type link for relations between
objects of metadata models. Tabs are defined and described by their
name. Selection of tab indicates the relation between metadata models.
Tabs will be preconfigured with the relation of metadata models but a
user can anytime change the relation of tabs either by adding a new tab
or by making changes in the existing one.
