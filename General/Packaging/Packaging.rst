Packaging
=========

User lands up to this screen from global menu. As the name suggests this
section is used to configure all types of packaging in boxes. This
section is needed when objects which are ordered are tangible and is
supposed to be received at users' place. Now there are different objects
which also vary according to size so, to pack the objects in box users
are supposed to give the dimension of box or container which will carry
the object. The box may have a tilt which can be informed by the check
box given below.

To make it easier for users', the left side of the screen will display a
list of pre-configured packaging types wherein already dimensions are
mentioned. However, users' may either add new packaging types or can
make changes into the existing ones.
