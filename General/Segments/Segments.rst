Segments
========

As the name suggest, this section bifurcates the Metamodels into
different segments. It makes different segments in the database of the
metadata objects. A drop-down list of segments is shown when a user
add/edit metadata model in content management system. This section is a
repository of metadata objects. The user can navigate from the global
menu under general, ‘segments' where the list of segments is displayed
towards the left side of the screen. A user can click on any segment
mentioned in the list to view them, the description will be shown in a
single line of text. For example, a user created a segment called
‘library', so now user can go to the content management system and add
metadata model ‘books' in ‘library' segment.

Initially segments will be pre-configured but eventually, the user may either add or edit the segments by following steps:
