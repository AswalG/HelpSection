Front-end theme
===============

As the name suggest this function allows users to change the look and
feel of the user interface. The users can configure the theme by
navigating to these screens by the global menu. The templates are
pre-define and will not be allowed to edit or delete by the user
although the user may duplicate the pre-defined theme and edit it
manually. All the pre-configured themes will be displayed in the left
pane of the screen. The theme which is highlighted in green color
depicts that this particular theme is active but a user can only active
theme by clicking on â€˜Apply' button. The user can also change the font
size and style of the system.
